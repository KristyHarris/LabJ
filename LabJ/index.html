        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="about">
            I have been interested in gardening since I was a child helping on the family farm. 
            I am currently a <abbr title="Michigan State University Extension">MSUE</abbr> Master Gardener Trainee.
            (For more about the Master Gardener program, click <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/master_gardener_volunteer_program/">here</a>.)
            I am presently in the process of reworking my yard to include plants that are friendly to pollinators and the environment ... plus a rose garden.

        <p>
            Italian arum (<i>Arum italicum</i>) is a unique plant that provides some great early color.  
            As the winter fades, this plant emerges from the snow ready to go with distinctive leaves that are deep green leaves with light veining.
            Around April or May, white flower pods, surrounded by cream/pale geeen spathes, emerge from the ground.   
            As the summer progesses, the spathes wither, and the white flower pods turn into a cluster of red berries.
            By late summer, the leaves and berries have wilted and die back, but leaves may emerge again in the fall.
            A word of caution, this leaves and berries of this plant can be toxic if ingested.
